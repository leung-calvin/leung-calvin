### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am a scientist that uses computational tools to tackle interesting biological questions.
- I work on transcriptomics and epigenomics, with a focus on investigating differential RNA splicing and isoform usage in human neurons.
- I primarily use R and Python to perform my computational work.
- In my free time, I enjoy learning new Unix/Linux features and tricks!
